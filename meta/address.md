An address is a string that unambiguously describes what it refers to.

An address is only meaningful in the context of a [protocol](protocol.md), which indicates how the address should be interpreted.  This is true not just of Unrival addresses, but of any addresses.  For instance, an [IP-address](../environment/technology/IP-address.md) tells a router where a resource can be found, but since there is no guarantee that the data eventually found there is the data expected, it does not qualify as an [unrival](unrival.md) address.  Similarly, postal addresses only make sense given a system of interpretation.
