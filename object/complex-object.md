Complex objects are [object](object.md)s that consist of [part](../meta/part.md)s.

With the exception of the empty context, every complex object contains a [context](complex/context.md), which is required for assigning [value](../meta/value.md)s to [interpretation](simple/interpretation.md)s (i.e. interpreting objects).
