An object is something that can be unambiguously referenced by means of an [address](../meta/address.md)

A simple object is an object containing no [part](../meta/part.md)s.

The following are simple objects:

* [proof](proof.md)
* [name](name.md)
* [interpretation](interpretation.md)
* [blob](blob.md)

Complex objects are objects that consist of parts.

With the exception of the empty context, every complex object contains a [context](context.md), which is required for assigning [value](../meta/value.md) to an [interpretation](interpretation.md)
