A ledger is a [complex-object](../complex-object.md) consisting of references to [claim](claim.md)s and [assessment](assessment.md)s.

A ledger extends the [credit-commons-protocol](../../environment/technology/credit-commons-protocol.md) by adding [interpretation](../simple/interpretation.md)s to entries.  These can be thought of as the domains in which credibility is staked.
