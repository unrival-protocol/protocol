A claim is a complex [object](object.md) that contains a predicate that:

1. can be asserted about an object
1. requires input from an [agent](agent.md) in order to be verified.

Verifying claims often requires subjective evalation from an agent, as opposed to proofs, whose criteria are objectively satisfied or not.
