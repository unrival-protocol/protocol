A name is a simple [object](object.md) and a possibly indistinct label applied to another object.  For example, `dog` is a name.

As opposed to this, a distinct label is called an [address](../meta/address.md).  For example, the [ipfs](../environment/technology/IPFS.md) address associated with `dog` is: `QmXQKbAA75HTxiGQz3JJzzLgn2PJc7nRVM2jXPRJGGwK3Y`.
