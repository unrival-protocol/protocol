A context is a complex [object](README)  that contains:

1. a set of [interpretation](interpretation.md)s associated with [value](../meta/value.md)s.
1. a set of [ledger](ledger.md)s bijectively mapped to this set of interpretations.
1. a reference to one or more parent contexts, whose [part](../meta/part.md)s (i.e. value mappings and ledger states) are inherited.
